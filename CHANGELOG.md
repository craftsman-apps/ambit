## 0.1.0 (2026-10-12)

First release. Ambit is Alpha software: the API is `ambitproject.dev/v1alpha1` and can change between releases.

- Access rules from identity-provider groups for models and for MCP servers and their tools.
- MCP servers run by ToolHive or remote, with per-person sign-in to work apps, tool pinning, argument limits and
  masking of personal data in tool results.
- Personal API keys for tools that cannot refresh a sign-in, and offboarding by SCIM that ends sessions and keys
  and revokes app grants where the vendor allows it.
- Daily budgets per group and per person, in requests or estimated dollars.
- Audit records of every call in ClickHouse, with a console page to search and export them.
- GitOps mode: console changes become pull requests, and Argo CD applies them.
- Container image with an SBOM and build provenance; Helm charts at `ghcr.io/craftsman-apps/charts`.

Upgrade: there is no earlier release to upgrade from.

Security: this release fixes no publicly known vulnerability.
