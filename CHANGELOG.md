# Changelog

This file lists the major changes of each release, what you must do when you upgrade, and the publicly known
vulnerabilities that the release fixes. The release page on GitHub also lists every merged pull request.
For upgrade steps in detail, read [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md).

## Unreleased

Add a line here for each change that users can see, in the pull request that makes the change.

- Audit-only mode (`access.mode: audit`): every signed-in request to a model or an MCP tool goes through, every tool is
  listed to everyone, and each audit record says whether the access rules in force at that moment would have refused
  it. The console shows a banner, a "would be refused" badge and filter, and a summary on the Audit page.
  `ambit check --production` has the new check P11. Sign-in, offboarding, budgets, argument limits and tool approval
  stay enforced. See [Turn Ambit on without blocking anyone](docs/guides/audit-only.md).
- Each change of a mode or of the access rules now waits until agentgateway reports it applied, and a change that is
  not applied within `access.activationTimeout` (120 s) shows `ModeSwitchStalled` or `RulesNotActive` on the
  AccessRules. `ambit local up` waits for the first rule to be Ready.
- `ambit connect` and `ambit disconnect` wait up to 60 seconds for the keychain (the unlock dialog of a Linux
  desktop); `ambit key print` still waits 2 seconds.

Upgrade: the AgentgatewayPolicy `ambit-access-log` is now written by `ambit-controller` (same name), so there is a
gap of about a second without an access-log policy during the upgrade, and a rollback to an earlier chart needs four
manual commands. See [docs/upgrading.md](docs/upgrading.md#to-the-release-with-audit-only-mode).

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-12)

First release. Ambit is Alpha software: the API is `ambitproject.dev/v1alpha1` and can change between releases.

- Access rules from identity-provider groups for models and for MCP servers and their tools.
- MCP servers run by ToolHive or remote, with per-person sign-in to work apps, tool pinning, argument limits and
  masking of personal data in tool results.
- Personal API keys for tools that cannot refresh a sign-in, and offboarding by SCIM that ends sessions and keys
  and revokes app grants where the vendor allows it.
- Daily budgets per group and per person, in requests or estimated dollars.
- Audit records of every call in ClickHouse, with a console page to search and export them.
- GitOps mode: console changes become pull requests, and Argo CD applies them.
- Container image with an SBOM and build provenance; Helm charts at `ghcr.io/craftsman-apps/charts`.

Upgrade: there is no earlier release to upgrade from.

Security: this release fixes no publicly known vulnerability.
